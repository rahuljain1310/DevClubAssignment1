Dev Club is a student group that tries to innovate and foster technical activities, and create a coding culture which is somewhat missing in IIT Delhi. And the club develop cool stuff that benefits everyone in the campus. If I would be a part of Dev Club, it would give me a experience on how development is done in a team. It will enhance my skills and my learning.
